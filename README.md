# bubblePop
I needed to host it, so I made a new repo, this game doesn't reflect the kind of games I make, this was for an assignment.

Oversimplified, the project was to create sumn for kids to build their motor skills. I had three other people working with me. Each of us had to make our own games and link them together in one p5 js app. This repos has my code isolated from the main project. I only contributed in the navigator(to select the game) apart from my own game and hence chose not to upload the whole repos.

Being in the top 0.1% in aimlabs flicking(I never do gridshot, that's for neck beards), I decided to make an aimlabs clone.

It's better than general aimlabs even though I just have one task as being better than aimlabs is a very low bar. 

I say everything ironically, don't take me seriously unless I say it in a scottish accent, because then you wouldnt understand what I said but it was important and now you're screwed.
