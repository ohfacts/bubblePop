# bubblePop
I needed to host it, so I made a new repo, this game doesn't reflect the kind of games I make, this was for an assignment.

Oversimplified, the project was to create sumn for kids to build their motor skills. Being in the top 0.1% in aimlabs flicking(I never do gridshot, that's for neck beards), I decided to make an aimlabs clone.

It's better than general aimlabs even though I just have one task as being better than aimlabs is a very low bar. 

I say everything ironically, don't take me seriously unless I say it in a scottish accent, because then you wouldnt understand what I said but it was important and now you're screwed.
